## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 6 -
This was a very fun lab because it was involved with food and it was a very straight forward lab, it wasnâ€™t too hard or too easy, it was just a bit of defining the string variable, printed a couple of the output, took in a couple of arguments from users as input and used one condition statements.


Lab 9 - 
For this lab it became one of my favorites to do because it was quite hard, part 1 has a bit of an issue but we manage to clear it before class ends, learning how to code the average mean of all the elements of scores and computing the minimum and maximum.


Lab 10 - 
For this third lab that became one of my favorites is also one of the toughest ones this semester, it was to do with testing the given parameter and see if it was given prime or not. Learning the loop and boolean and converting the number to integers.
